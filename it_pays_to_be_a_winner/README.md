# Test One Review
I pays to be a winner. There is the person who won and the rest who didn't. Go Navy.

While this isn't the Navy, I still will give you the opportunities they gave me. For this test,
and because it is your first test in computer science, I will give you the benefit of proving to me that not being the winner was a fluke. I believe in every single one of you and believe every single one of you have what it takes to be the winner.

Yet, there will come a time where you cannot fall back on someone else to make it. There comes a time when you have to figure it out on your own to survive. While this course is obviously not life and death, what you do from here on out will set the tone for how well you will succeed in your computer related field.

So here it is. I will give you the opportunity to earn 10 points towards your test by answering a set of questions according to what you missed on the test. The less you got wrong, the easier the job is. This is your reward for preparing the adequate amount of time. Those of you who didn't prepare adequately compared to the winner, here is your chance to prove to that person you are just as capable and that they were lucky to win.

For each of you, I have linked a set of questions that you can answer. It's up to you. If you don't want to earn those extra points, you do not have to. If you do want them, you will have to answer them **thoroughly**. How thorough? Well, I am not sure. It depends on how well I think you understand it.

These questions must be submitted Friday, Sept 30 at 8am. If not all answers are satisfactorily completed, you will get no points. If you prove to me you now understand them all, you will get the points. You may confer with me through email, mobile, etc, to discuss the topic. This means you do not have to only submit your answers on Friday, but throughout the week is acceptable, as long as you submit a **FULL** set of answers Friday.

I would advise you use my personal email for the quickest response. You may work as a team, but you will need to submit your own answer, as well as citing all the sources you used. Citing does not need to be formal, but I need to be able to see that you didn't copy/paste and regurgitate an answer. You must prove to me you understand it.

You may also be getting a coding assignment that will be part of this. It may not be due Friday with this portion. This will be personalized to where your skill level is and where I think it needs to be. I will email that to you soon.
