# CPS 176 Extra Credit  

This will be worth 5% of your overall grade. It is the curve. The amount you receive will depend on the meeting the criteria in the grading section.

## Topic

I want you to investigate a topic that excites or entertains you about Computer Science. The choice is yours but must be approved by the instructor for scope and scale.

## Grading

Grades will be divided into 5 sections. The first 4 sections are meetings with the instructor about your progress, questions, concerns, etc. These need to be scheduled and the meetings need to be about 20-30 minutes long. We will not schedule meetings during class hours. The final section is a class presentation. The idea behind the presentation to share what you learned with the other students to hopefully inspire them to investigate your topic. So make it fun and exciting! Each section is weighted equally, but must be completed linearly. This means if you have not met with me 4 times about your project, you cannot present. Our meetings must be at least 2 weeks apart. So no meet Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and present on Friday of the last week of school.

### Meetings Criteria

You must show significant progress for each meeting. Significant progress is personalized and not compared to other students. This means when we meet, it is up to you to show you have progressed adequately. Our first meeting will be about the scope of the project, where you are now in regards to the topic. This creates a baseline. It is completely ok to know nothing about the topic.

### Presentation Criteria

Your presentation should be adequately long enough to cover the topic. You will be graded on how well you presented the information that you learned from the previous 4 meetings.

#### Presentation Suggestions

Don't go too far into the weeds. Keep it entertaining. You should be able to demonstrate the basic idea behind the topic and talk about how the topic is useful and why others should learn it. I couldn't imagine this taking more than 10-15 minutes, but if you want the whole hour, let me know in advance.

Be prepared to answer questions. You need to present yourself as a "domain expert" on this topic. Of course this is relative to your peers. If your topic is Artificial Intelligence and you cannot talk about what algorithms are supervised or unsupervised, cannot explain in 200 level terms what the difference between supervised and unsupervised is, I will not consider you a domain expert. But at the same time, if your doing AI, I would never expect you to tell me the difference of Mamdami Fuzzy Inference computation costs vs Sugeno-Type Inference.

## The only rule besides those for Grading

ENJOY YOURSELF! If the direction of the extra credit project seems boring, bring it up in a meeting and let us see how we can refactor it into something more enjoyable. That would include starting a new topic at no penalty.
