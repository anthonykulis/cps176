# Lab One

## Theme - RPG Character Creation Part 1
You will create a basic driver to collect character information from the user.

## Minimum Requirements
For this lab, you will be required to collect:
  1. The Character Name
  2. A description of the Character (eg class, looks, w/e)
  3. Roll a 20 sided die to adjust the base attributes
  4. Print out a character sheet (name, description, stats) to the terminal.

## Tips
* You will need a variable of type String for the character name
* You will need a variable of type String for the character description
* You will need at minimum 5 variables of type int for the character attributes of
  * Strength
  * Dexterity
  * Constitution
  * Intelligence
  * Defense
* You will need to use the Math class to roll a random number modulated by 21
* You will need to cast that random number to type int and add it to an attribute
  * You will initialize your Base Attributes to 5
* You will need to repeat this for each attribute (do not use a loop)
* You will need to print to the terminal in the format of:

```
Character Name: [NAME]
Character Desc: [DESCRIPTION]

Stats
-----
Strength: [STR]
Dexterity: [DXR]
Constitution: [CONST]
Intelligence: [INT]
Defense: [DEF]
```

## Grading
This is your first of the 8 programming assignments. This means it is worth 25 points.

## Due Date
This assignment will be due Tuesday, September 13, 2016 at 8:00am.

## Extra Information
This assignment utilizes the skills you have already learned. There is no need to take it any further by using condition or iterative logic. Our next lab will utilize that and also save this to a file for recall later. So failing to complete this on time will only set you back further. Assignment 2 will be immediately given at the due date and due time.

## Solution
The solution will be posted on the due date at the due time. Because of so, there will be no extra time afforded to complete this assignment.
