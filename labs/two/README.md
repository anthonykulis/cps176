# Lab 2

## Theme - RPG Character Generation Part 2
Port your current program (or the solution provided on github) to a *declarative* methodology. This means you will create *methods* to handle your *block* logic. For example, the two lines of code to ask and collect the character name will be in a method.

## Methods
Use the following methods in your class.

```java
public void collectCharacterName(){
  // ask and save character name
}

public void collectCharacterDescription(){
  //ask and save character description
}

public void randomlyUpdateAttributes(){
  // roll for attributes and update base attributes
}

public String toString(){
  // return a string of the character sheet
}

private int _roll(){
  // return a random roll from the 20 sided die
}

public static void main(String[] args){
  // instead of doing the *imperative* character building, call
  // your methods instead *declaratively*
}
```

## Tips
Since this is a port of your first lab, the same rules for how attributes, printing of character sheet, etc, still apply.

## Grading
This is your second of the 8 programming assignments. This means it is worth 25 points.

## Due Date
This assignment will be due Tuesday, September 20, 2016 at 8:00am. Submit your `.java` file to D2L by 8am.
