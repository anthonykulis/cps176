# Test One Review
* 105 out of 100 points. Means 5 points extra credit for exam only.
* Covers Chapter 3

## Content
* If/Else
* Switch
* Ternary | Conditional
* Programming using if/else

## Tips
* While there isn't much to test, you will be tested thoroughly. This means repeated questions about `if-else` statements, `switch` statements, and `conditional` (`ternary`) operators.
* Make sure to know the 3 grammars
* Make sure to write down the three grammars immediately
  * Use these as a template to solve every problem
* Boolean expressions are obviously a big part of this test
* Understand the syntax of `if-else` statements such that you can identify syntactically correct and incorrect statements.
* Understand the syntax of `switch` statements such that you can identify syntactically correct and incorrect statements.
* Understand the syntax of `conditional` (`ternary`) statements such that you can identify syntactically correct and incorrect statements.

## Side stuff
* `printf` - make sure you can read the statement and provide outputs.
  * Know things like `"%.2f"` and what that does. You should be able to do the basics
* Understand "flag" variables, meaning I use a flag instead of a raw expression in the boolean expression.
  * eg `boolean isFalse = false` for `if(isFalse){}`
