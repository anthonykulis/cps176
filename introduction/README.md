# Introduction
## Formatting
I will provide a README.md file for each section in this repository. Typically they will give instructions how to run the source code provided. For the introduction we will have no source code.

I will also provide questions from the book that I wish you to complete. These will be homework assignments and typically will be short answer type questions. They are intended to keep you focused and will not be too difficult.

Programming assignments will also be detailed in this README.md.
