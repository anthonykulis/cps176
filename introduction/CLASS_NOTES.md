# Introduction to Computers and Java
Class notes for Chapter 1

## 1.1 Introduction
* Before diving into code, we need to understand the fundamentals of how hardware and software work together.  

## 1.2 Why Program?
### Computers can perform many various operations because they are programmed.
* As an counter example, an Integrated Circuit (IC) can only perform one job and are the "fastest" logic controllers
* As another counter example, a FPGA can perform many tasks, including those found in many ICs, may perform faster than CPUs and slower than ICs. Their benefit is that their intended logic can be developed faster than ICs (and slower than CPU based software). This provides a middle ground between an IC and a CPU based system.
* As a final counter example, a Micro-Controller (uC) is excellent as performing a define set of tasks, is very nimble for development, but is not typically as specific as a FPGA and is a lot less flexible as a CPU.
* CPU based systems are "general" and because of the extra underlying layers to make them general, tend to perform slower than their FPGA and IC counter parts. This allows massive flexibility, hence why we have ubiquitous computing on CPU based systems and not ICs, FPGAs, or even uCs.
* The CPU via an *instruction set* allows it to be programmed.
  * Writing programs with a CPU instruction set is time consuming at a minimum.
  * Over time we have developed layers of abstraction to access the instruction set.
  * There are considered to be 4 generations of languages. This class will cover a 3rd generation language (Java)

## 1.3 Computer Systems: Hardware and Software
### All computer systems use the Von Neuman architecture. This allows for similar hardware interfacing and software development.
